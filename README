== Required software =========================
 - Python 2.7
 - Icarus Verilog (for simulation) [http://iverilog.icarus.com/]
 - Altera Quartus (for FPGA)
 - GNU Make

== Assembling programs (in the test directory) =====

  tools/assemble.py tests/sourcefile.hex tests/sourcefile.asm

  Replace 'sourcefile' in the command line with the desired file.

== Running in Verilog simulation =====================

  1. Build the verilog model:

     cd rtl
     make

  2. Run a verilog model making the +bin parameter point to the program you want to run, which should have been assembled already above.

     vvp multi-sim.vvp +bin=../tests/sourcefile.hex -lxt2

  Any value written to address 0xFFFF will be displayed on the console.  A trace file will be dumped into 'trace.lxt', which can be read with GTKWave or the like.

== Running on FPGA (Cyclone II Starter Kit) ===============

  1. Assemble the bootloader.  

     cd rtl
     make

  2. Copy the assembled program into fpga/cIIstarter/program.hex.

  3. Synthesize design by opening 'fpga/cIIstarter/cIIstarter.qpf'.  Note that the design needs to be resynthesized each time the program is changed.
